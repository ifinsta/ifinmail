# Changelog

## v0.0.1
First working release.

- One-command install verified end to end; mail delivery fixes (Postfix chroot, Dovecot volume
  ownership); setup wizard required until finished; forced first password; optional two-factor;
  System health page; one brand name default.
- `make update [TO=vX.Y.Z]` with a database and configuration snapshot, automatic rollback if the
  new version is not healthy, and `make rollback` (code and database) / `make version`.
- The console shows the installed version and announces new releases (six-hourly GitHub check,
  can be switched off).
- `make uninstall` undoes the installation (including anonymous volumes of the stack's
  containers); `--check` lists anything left.
- New mailboxes: the setup link and getting-started instructions (mail app settings) can be
  emailed to an address the owner already reads, when the mailbox is created or later from the
  mailbox list or profile.
