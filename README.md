# ifinmail

**A secure, API-first email platform. One contract. Many clients. Minimal dependencies.**

ifinmail is an open-source email platform designed to compete with Outlook and Gmail while giving users and businesses more control, transparency, and trust. It combines battle-tested mail infrastructure (Postfix, Dovecot, Rspamd) with a modern API-first product layer (Python, Rust) and framework-free clients (Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, web).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| SMTP | Postfix | Inbound/outbound mail delivery, queue management |
| IMAP / MDA | Dovecot | Mailbox storage (Maildir), IMAP access, LMTP delivery |
| Filtering | Rspamd | Spam, DKIM, DMARC, SPF, greylisting, reputation |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Users, domains, mail metadata, audit logs |
| Cache / Queues | Redis | Rate limits, counters, sessions, task queues |
| API Backend | Django + Django Ninja | REST API, admin dashboard (built-in), auth, orchestration |
| Background Tasks | Celery + Redis | DNS verification, bounce processing, reputation tracking |
| Core Libraries | Rust | Mail parsing, crypto, sync engine, policy engine |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | Webmail, admin dashboard — no React/Angular/Vue |
| Infra | Docker Compose, nginx, Certbot | Deployment, TLS, service management |

## Guiding Principles

- **One mail platform. One API contract. Many clients.** Every official client (Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, web) relies on the same backend API. No fragmentation.
- **Minimal dependencies.** No React, Angular, Vue, or heavy JavaScript build pipelines. Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS with `.ifinmail-*` CSS prefixing. Pinned and audited dependencies with SBOMs.
- **Proven mail infrastructure.** Postfix, Dovecot, and Rspamd are battle-tested. ifinmail builds a modern product layer on top, not a replacement.
- **Security by design.** Argon2id password hashing, TLS everywhere, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, device-specific credentials, supply-chain security with signed commits and releases.

## Quick Start

> The project is in early development. The guide above is the starting point for new engineers joining the team.

### For New Team Members

Start with the [curriculum guide](guide/README.md). It is a 12-week, self-paced program that takes you from Linux fundamentals to building a working mini-ifinmail prototype. No prior email systems knowledge is required.

### For Everyone Else

Read the [full proposal](ifinmail_proposal.md) to understand the product vision, architecture, and development phases.

## Development Status

- **Current version**: v0.0.1 (proposal and curriculum only)
- **Phase**: Pre-implementation — building the engineering team

### Development Phases (from proposal)

| Phase | Scope |
|---|---|
| 1 — Foundation | Postfix, Dovecot, Rspamd, PostgreSQL, Django Admin, simple webmail |
| 2 — API Contract & Web Client | OpenAPI contract (Django Ninja), Mail/Auth/Admin/Bootstrap APIs, framework-free web client |
| 3 — Reputation & Abuse | Trust levels, sending limits, bounce/complaint handling, deliverability dashboard |
| 4 — Android Client | Native Kotlin client, Rust core via JNI, encrypted cache, push notifications |
| 5 — Desktop Clients | Windows, macOS, Linux clients, signed installers, auto-update |
| 6 — Scale & Business | Organization policies, shared mailboxes, dedicated IPs, calendar/contacts |
